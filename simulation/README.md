[filipradenovic/revisitop](https://github.com/filipradenovic/revisitop) provides a very good data and evaluation implementation function, but the detailed code is hard to understand (personally). So I created the `simulation` folder, which realized the same functions of data downloading and result evaluation, and modified some codes, which made me understand and use it more deeply.
